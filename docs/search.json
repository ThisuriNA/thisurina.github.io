Using Power BI dashboards, we applied KPIs, DAX measures, and interactive visuals to evaluate promotion effectiveness, forecast accuracy, and product performance. The study revealed that promotions often failed to boost sales and deep discounts reduced profit margins, leading to recommendations for smarter discounting strategies, targeted promotions, and product diversification."
